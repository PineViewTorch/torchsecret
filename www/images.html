    <h1>TorchSecret Image Search</h1>
    <h2>For use by staff members to find images for postcards</h2>
    <h3>Searches Google Images for items "labeled for reuse"</h3>
    <form action="http://images.google.com/images" method="GET">
      <input type="hidden" name="as_rights"
        value="(cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived)" />
      <input id="search-query" type="text" name="as_q" />
      <input type="submit" value="Image Search" />
    </form>
    <p>
      <strong>Important!</strong> Make sure that, on finding an image, you do
      all of the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Read the license</strong> - make sure it does, in fact, allow
        you to use the image. (On Flickr, for example, find the link on the
        right sidebar that says "some rights reserved".) Note the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You <strong>may</strong> use images marked for non-commerical
            purposes (slash through dollar sign).
          </li>
          <li>
            You <strong>may not</strong> use images that disallow derivative
            works (equals sign).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Write down the author of the image</strong> - if the license
        requires attribution, which it likely will, the author will have to be
        listed somewhere in the paper.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="loud">
      This information must be included on submitting your postcard!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you just grab an image, lose the page, and then submit your secret,
      you will be forced to start from scratch, as we can <strong>not</strong>
      use any postcard that violates copyright, and attribution is a key part
      of most re-use licenses.
