    <h1>TorchSecret Image Search</h1>
    <h2>For use by staff members to find images for postcards</h2>
    <h3>Searches Google Images for items "labeled for reuse"</h3>
    <form action="http://images.google.com/images" method="GET">
      <input type="hidden" name="as_rights"
        value="(cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived)" />
      <input id="search-query" type="text" name="as_q" />
      <input type="submit" value="Image Search" />
    </form>
    <p>
      <strong>Important!</strong> Make sure that, on finding an image, you find
      two important details:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>The license itself</strong> - make sure it does, in fact,
        allow you to use the image. (On Flickr, for example, find the link on
        the right sidebar that says "some rights reserved".) We are a non-profit
        publication, so you <em>may</em> use images under a non-commerical
        license.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The creator of the image</strong> - if the license requires
        attribution, which it likely will, this will have to be listed
        somewhere in the paper.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="loud">
      This information must be included on submitting your postcard!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you just grab an image, lose the page, and then submit your secret,
      you will be forced to start from scratch, as we can <strong>not</strong>
      use any postcard that violates copyright, and attribution is a key part
      of most re-use licenses.
