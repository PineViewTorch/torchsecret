TorchSecret
===========

This is the TorchSecret source code.

This particular project is written in PHP. Though the main site is written
in Ruby on Rails (and we love it dearly!), that seemed a bit of an overkill
for a standalone project, and I've been working in PHP5 OOP lately, anyway.

Feel free to poke around to learn or inspect. The goal of the app is to
maintain a system where we can inspect the secrets that are submitted fully
anonymously, while still implementing a decent anti-spam mechanism. So as not
to make anything too easy for potential spammers, I won't go into the details,
but you'll note that, though secrets are to an extent tracked, it's only a very
superficial tracking system, and stores no personally identifying information
about the user (such as their IP address).

If you find anything that could potentially make it possible for us to track
down identities of users, please send us an e-mail - or, if you're a coder,
write the patch yourself and send in a pull request!

Thanks for your help!

(You may note that key files are omitted here for obvious security reasons:
the DB configuation file, for one, and the password file for users allowed
to access the TorchSecret staff panel. If any member of the Pine View staff
would like to confirm that there is no code stealthily hidden away in either of
these files, I would be happy to oblige if you drop me a line at
matthew.dunnrankin % pineviewtorch.com)
